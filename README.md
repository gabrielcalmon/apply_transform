# apply_transform
This repository was developed to accomplish the proposed challenge of to get a transformed point B obtained from the point PA = [aPx aPy aPz] after applying a translation of [ 1 2 3 ] and a rotation around x axis of theta degrees. Also, it was required to document the solution through a Use Case Diagrame and a Sequence Diagram.

*Note: this package was developed and tested on ROS2 humble with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS*
## Mathematical definition
A general transformation between two points can be defined as follow:
$$^{B}P=^{B}_AT^{A}P$$

Which is equivalent to:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
^{B}P_x\\ 
^{B}P_y\\ 
^{B}P_z\\
1
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 1\\ 
0 & \cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta) & 2\\ 
0 & \sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta) & 3\\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}

\begin{bmatrix}
^{A}P_x\\ 
^{A}P_y\\ 
^{A}P_z\\
1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

And can be evaluated to:

$$ 
\left\{\begin{matrix}
^{B}P_x = ^{A}P_x+1\\ 
^{B}P_y = \cos(\theta)^{A}P_y -\sin(\theta)^{A}P_z + 2\\ 
^{B}P_z = \sin(\theta)^{A}P_y +\cos(\theta)^{A}P_z + 3
\end{matrix}\right.
$$

## Inputs and Outputs
The expected inputs are:
- $^{A}P$
- angle Î¸ (in degrees); This angle should be between 0 and 90 degrees.
Otherwise, the server must return an error

While the outputs are:
- $^{B}P$
- Status message
- Success boolean

So, to implement this interface, the following srv structure, available on the srv/ folder, was created:
```bash
float64[3] point_a
float64 theta
---
float64[3] point_b
string message
bool sucess
```

## Setup
First, create your workspace
```bash
$ mkdir ~/ros2_ws/src -p
``` 

Build and source the package
```bash
$ cd ~/ros2_ws/
$ colcon build
$ source install/setup.bash
``` 

## Usage
Start the server
```bash
$ ros2 run apply_transform get_transform_server
``` 

Run the client, passing the components of $^{A}P$ vector and desired angle of rotation
```bash
$ ros2 run apply_transform get_transform_client <aPx> <aPy> <aPz> <theta>
```
